fixed acidity: "Affects many important properties of the wine including color, taste, and smell."
volatile acidity: "Amount of acetic acid in wine, high levels can lead to a vinegar-like taste."
citric acid: "Found in small quantities, can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines."
residual sugar: "Amount of sugar remaining after fermentation, affects sweetness and texture."
chlorides: "Amount of salt in the wine, influencing its saltiness."
free sulfur dioxide: "Acts as a preservative, inhibits microbial growth, and preserves freshness in white wines."
total sulfur dioxide: "High levels can lead to a pungent, burnt match aroma and thus help detect poor quality."
density: "Refers to the wine's mass per unit volume. Higher density leads to fuller and richer taste."
pH: "Measures how acidic or basic a wine is, most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale."
sulphates: "Indicator of added sulfites, helping to preserve wine and protect from oxidation."
alcohol: "Percentage of alcohol present in the wine, affects taste, body, and aroma."
price: "Mostly influenced by factors like branding, marketing, and rarity. Not very indicative of quality."
kcal: "Caloric content of the wine, more informational regarding dietary considerations than quality."
production volume: "The quantity produced of the particular brand."
sediment volume: "Amount of solid particles that may form in wine. Mostly reflects age, but not quality of the wine."
opacity: "Relevant for appearance, but not an indicator of actual quality."
magnesium oxide: "Reflects chemical characteristics of the vineyard soil but has little impact on taste."
total potassium: "Amount of potassium in the wine, can affect aspects like acidity but not a direct quality indicator."
ph: "Measures how acidic or basic a wine is, most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale."
age: "Years since the wine was harvested."
